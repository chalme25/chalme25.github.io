          <p class="tanigawa-p1">
            Just before the coronavirus made waves and lockdowns in Japan, I headed to Mt Tsukuba in Ibaraki prefecture for my first climb of 2020. Mt Tsukuba is a well known day trip spot from Tokyo as it’s relatively big for a mountain in the great Kanto plain. It can be reached by taking the Tsukuba Express line from Akihabara station to Tsukuba station for 1 hour followed by a 30 minute bus ride.

            The climb will start at a shrine at the base of the mountain. After a sturdy climb through rocks and the forest you’ll come to a clearing. From here the top of the mountain is another hour climb. At the top you can find a restaurant, shops, and an observation deck where you can catch a view surrounded by the Kanto plain and Kasumigaura Bay to the east. It is also possible to see taller peaks to the north in Tochigi prefecture.

            This hike is a good introduction for those wanting to dip their toes into Japanese mountain hiking. The climb isn’t too steep or long and has a lot of the staples you’d expect from a Japanese mountain: shrines, cable cars, nice views, and a restaurant at the top to eat lunch at. It will be a full day trip from Tokyo, but if you’re looking for an average challenge level hike that beginners and veterans can enjoy together than this mountain is a good climb. I went at the end of February when there was a famous plum blossom festival which made this hike more memorable. Seeing the first signs of spring explode with colour on the side of the mountain is a view I’ll never forget and recommend to everyone.
