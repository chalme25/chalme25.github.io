            Straddling the border of Gunma and Niigata: Mt Tanigawa is a popular hike near some of the most popular ski resorts in Japan. It’s possible to do this hike as a day trip from Tokyo albeit expensive as you’ll need to take shinkansen. I woke up early to catch a shinkansen from Tokyo station to Jomokogen station which took about an hour. From Jomokogen you can take a bus to the Tanigawa ropeway which takes another 45 minutes. Take the ropeway through the valley and once you get off, the trail to the mountain will be on the right.

            I completed this climb at the end of October during peak autumn leaf season. The climb has you facing Mt Tanigawa with the trail being a giant “U” shape. After about 30 minutes of forest hiking, the challenging part begins when you pass the tree line. Make sure to prepare proper shoes as this hike isn’t meant for casual wear. The ascent will be up a ridgeline for an hour until you reach a rest station. After catching a break, the summit is another 15 minute climb and you’ll be rewarded with a fantastic view.

           Mt Tanigawa should be on every mountaineers bucket list in Japan. 
           The ease of access from Tokyo makes it one of the tallest mountains 
           that you can do as a day trip. It will be expensive as you need to take shinkansen,
           but anyone into mountain climbing will enjoy this and should give it a go if possible.
           If you can't manage to do it as a day trip then I recommend going to Nagano as a better alternative 
           as you can travel there for a similar cost with better mountains. Or you can spend the night at one of
           Gunma's famous hotsprings and make a weekend trip out of it.
